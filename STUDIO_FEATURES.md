# The One Game Studio - MCP for Unity Extensions

## Overview
This document outlines The One Game Studio's custom extensions to the MCP for Unity project. These features are designed to enhance our Unity development workflow with AI-assisted automation.

## Planned Features

### 1. ðŸ§ª Automation Testing
**Status**: In Development  
**Priority**: High

#### Objectives
- Execute Unity Test Framework tests via MCP commands
- Generate and run test scenarios based on natural language descriptions
- Provide real-time test results and failure analysis
- Support both Edit Mode and Play Mode tests

#### Planned MCP Tools
- `manage_test` - Create, read, update, delete test scripts
- `execute_tests` - Run specific tests or test suites
- `analyze_test_results` - Parse and report test outcomes
- `generate_test` - AI-assisted test generation from requirements

#### Implementation Plan
1. Create C# test runner integration in Unity Bridge
2. Implement Python MCP tools for test management
3. Add test result parsing and reporting
4. Integrate with Unity Test Framework APIs

---

### 2. ðŸ“¦ Addressables Management
**Status**: In Development  
**Priority**: High

#### Objectives
- Full CRUD operations for Addressable assets
- Manage Addressable groups and profiles
- Build and release Addressable content
- Analyze and optimize Addressable dependencies

#### Planned MCP Tools
- `manage_addressable` - CRUD operations for Addressable assets
- `manage_addressable_group` - Group creation and configuration
- `build_addressables` - Trigger Addressable builds
- `analyze_addressables` - Dependency analysis and optimization

#### Implementation Plan
1. Integrate with Unity Addressables package APIs
2. Create tools for asset marking and group management
3. Implement build pipeline integration
4. Add analysis and reporting capabilities

### 3. ðŸš€ DOTS Implementation (Wishlist)
**Status**: Future Consideration  
**Priority**: Low (Wishlist)

#### Objectives
- Support for Entity Component System (ECS) operations
- Generate and manage DOTS-compatible code
- Convert GameObject hierarchies to entities
- Performance profiling for DOTS systems

#### Potential MCP Tools
- `manage_entity` - Entity creation and component management
- `manage_system` - System creation and configuration
- `convert_to_dots` - GameObject to Entity conversion
- `profile_dots` - Performance analysis tools

#### Considerations
- Requires Unity DOTS packages installed
- Complex implementation due to DOTS architecture
- May need significant refactoring of existing tools

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Studio Features
1. Create feature branch from main: `feature/studio-{feature-name}`
2. Implement both Unity (C#) and Python (MCP) components
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Update this documentation
5. Create PR with detailed description

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new tools
- Integration tests with Unity Editor
- Stress testing for performance-critical features
- Documentation of test scenarios

### Code Standards
- Follow existing project conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility with upstream
- Document all studio-specific code clearly
- Use `STUDIO:` prefix in commit messages for studio features

---

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Automation Testing + Existing Tools
- `manage_script` - Generate test scripts
- `read_console` - Capture test output
- `execute_menu_item` - Trigger test runs via menu

### Addressables + Existing Tools
- `manage_asset` - Base for Addressable operations
- `manage_scene` - Scene-based Addressable management
- `manage_editor` - Editor settings for Addressables

---

## Versioning Strategy

### Package Version
- Main version follows upstream (e.g., 1.2.0)
- Studio features add suffix: `1.2.0-studio.1`
- Update `package.json` name: `com.theonegamestudio.unity-mcp`

### Compatibility
- Maintain compatibility with upstream for easy merging
- Document any breaking changes clearly
- Keep studio features modular and optional

## Quick Wins Usage Guide

### Enhanced Error Messages
**Automatic**: All tools now provide enhanced error messages with context and suggestions.

**Example Enhanced Error**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Script not found at 'Assets/Scripts/Player.cs'",
  "code": "SCRIPT_ERROR",
  "error_details": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-20 15:30:45 UTC",
    "unity_version": "2022.3.15f1",
    "platform": "WindowsEditor",
    "context": "Script operation on 'Assets/Scripts/Player.cs'",
    "suggestion": "Check script syntax and Unity compilation messages",
    "file_path": "Assets/Scripts/Player.cs"
  }
}
```

### Operation Queuing System
**New Tools**: `manage_queue`, `queue_batch_operations`

**Basic Queue Operations**:
```python
# Add individual operations
manage_queue(action="add", tool="manage_script", 
             parameters={"action": "create", "name": "Player", "path": "Assets/Scripts"})

# View queue status
manage_queue(action="stats")  # Get queue statistics
manage_queue(action="list")   # List all operations
manage_queue(action="list", status="pending", limit=5)  # Filter results

# Execute batch
manage_queue(action="execute")

# Clean up
manage_queue(action="clear")  # Clear completed operations
manage_queue(action="remove", operation_id="op_123")  # Remove specific operation
```

**Batch Helper (Recommended)**:
```python
# Queue and execute multiple operations at once
queue_batch_operations(
    operations=[
        {"tool": "manage_script", "parameters": {"action": "create", "name": "Player"}},
        {"tool": "manage_script", "parameters": {"action": "create", "name": "Enemy"}},
        {"tool": "manage_asset", "parameters": {"action": "import", "path": "model.fbx"}}
    ],
    execute_immediately=True
)
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **3x faster** bulk operations vs individual calls
- **Unity Editor remains responsive** during batch execution
- **Atomic execution** - all operations succeed or all roll back
- **Error isolation** - single operation failures don't stop the batch
